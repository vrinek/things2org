#+title: Things2Org

The (eventual) aim of this software is to provide bidirectional sync of Things.app and org-mode files.

To do this, it makes use of Things Cloud.

* Install

#+begin_src sh
bundle # installs the Ruby gems
#+end_src

* Running it

** Fetch your data

You will need to make your =history_key= available for this.

#+begin_src sh
history_key="[...]" ./fetch_all_history.fish
#+end_src

This will generate a bunch of =items.*.json= files with all your data.

** Print your inbox

#+begin_src sh
./make_inbox.rb > inbox.org
#+end_src

This will print your Things inbox as an org mode file.
